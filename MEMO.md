## Changelog Memo

### 2026-08-22

- [修复] Completed post-v1.5 validation, layout, generator, preview, import, and package hardening; see the Unreleased entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [验证] Added regression coverage for theme paths, nested non-finite values, TOC pagination, table widths, hyperlink schemes, CLI options, write guards, and import commit boundaries.
- [风险] Transitive `image-size@1.2.1` still has two high advisories with no patched upstream release; the audit gate was not disabled or bypassed with a breaking upgrade.
- [继续] Resume from Active maintenance follow-up in `docs/BACKLOG.md`; this hardening batch is intended for the next release.
